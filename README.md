# README for MarkovChainMonteCarlo Backtest Project

## Overview
This Python project implements a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach for backtesting strategies on S&P 500 stocks. It utilizes stochastic processes to simulate and analyze the probability distributions of stock returns, providing insights into investment strategies.

## Features
- **Markov Chain Implementation**: Generates a sequence of random variables for stock price simulation.
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Approximates the probability distribution of returns.
- **Backtesting Framework**: Evaluates investment strategies on historical S&P 500 stock data.
